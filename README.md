# legacy-launcher-nix
A quick and dirty Nix port of [Legacy Launcher](https://llaun.ch/en)

## Disclaimer
This is a simple and very unprofessional port to Nix. This is not intended to be used in a production
or high-security environment. This is just a hobby write so I can play LL as fast as possible.

Any feedback and PRs are welcome!



## Building

**Remember to allow unfree packages**
